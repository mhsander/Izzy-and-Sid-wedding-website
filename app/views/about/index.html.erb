      <h1>ðŸŒ» Dress up tips:</h1>
      <p>
       Ladies: Light summer dresses/pants with sandals/short-heeled shoes as you will be walking on grass and 
       donâ€™t want to look like velociraptors quietly stalking prey (weâ€™re also helping prevent future physical 
       therapy for your knees)<br><br>
       Gentlemen: Vests with light and colorful dress shirts so you can dance in style and carry us during the Hora
       without sweating too much.<br>
      </p><br><br>
        <h1>ðŸŒ» Portland is majestically green, so go outside and explore:</h1>
        <div id="about1">
          <%= image_tag "forrest_park.gif" %><br>
        </div>
        <p><u>Forest Park</u> - The countries largest city park is only Â½ mile from our doorstep! With over 80 miles of trails this is a great place to go for a walk without driving. 
        Whether you have an hour or all day, there are routes and options for all. <a href="https://www.pdxmonthly.com/articles/2017/5/15/eight-essential-forest-park-hikes" title="hikes" target="_blank">Click here to see top hikes to do while visiting</a><br><br></p><br>
        <p><u>St. Johns/Peninsula Park</u> - St. Johns is the closest neighborhood in Portland to us. And itâ€™s a cute super cute one. A small movie theater, bars, great restaurants and amazing parks make it a must on any visit to Portland. Cathedral Park under the St Johns Bridge is a great place to take a stroll before dinner or to have a picnic.
          The bigger park in the neighborhood is Peninsula Park and there you will find the closest disc golf course to us.
          Ask Sid to borrow some discs! But donâ€™t invite him if you decide to go two or three days before the wedding. Heâ€™s got waayyy too many things to do at that time.ðŸ’…</p>
        <p><u>Skyline Tavern</u> - The one and only bar near us, just 2 miles from the house. And would you look at that! They are a non-profit bar (betcha didnâ€™t know those existed, right? Well, welcome to Portland)! All proceeds go to scholarships for film school students.
          With great music 6 nights a week, a variety of local beer/cider options, yummy food, amazing outdoor seating, a ping pong table and BYO-BBQ, Skyline Tavern is a little taste of how awesome Portland can be.
          And itâ€™s just around the corner from us. <a href="https://skytav.com" title="Pre-party" target="_blank">This is where we'll pre-party on Friday evening!</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Sauvies Island</u> - What was once an island full of Wapato and mud is now a thriving agricultural community within the city limits.
          Not only are there great farm stands to check out (Krugerâ€™s Farm) but Portlandâ€™s own river beach on the east side of the island along the mighty Columbia River.
          A great place to visit so you can say youâ€™ve been both in WA and OR (the river separates both states) and you get the chance to maybe see some naked people in the nude section lololol because, why not?

          <u>Powellâ€™s City of Books:</u> Are you a bookworm? Do you miss the good olâ€™ days of hanging out at Barnes & Nobles? Does â€˜Litâ€™ get you lit? Then you have to check out Powellâ€™s.
          It is definitely in the top 10 classic places list to visit here, even if you come for 24 hours. Itâ€™s in the heart of downtown Portland (just 25min from our home, so thereâ€™s no excuse). They have everything. I mean EVERYTHING.
          Get yourself a little PDX souvenir (other than the wonderful wedding memories we know youâ€™ll have in your Instagram).
        </p>
        <p>
          Yeah, thatâ€™s the end of our list for indoor stuff, unless you want to check out museums.

          Other than that, GET READY TO THANK GLOBAL WARMING FOR YOUR SUFFERING! Portland did not realize it was going to get hotter every year, so most places donâ€™t have AC. Thatâ€™s why we highly recommend the following bars:

        <p>
          Our place is close to Downtown, but a car is definitely needed to get to us. 
          Portland has a lot of great Airbnb listings 20-30 minutes away. 
          There are also hotels around the area closer to our home.
